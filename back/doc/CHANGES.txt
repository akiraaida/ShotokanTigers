- Changed Account from nothing to public so that test cases can access it.
    - Changed all variables in Account from nothing to public so that test cases can access them
- Deleted the finally block in concatTrans() and moved the pwriter close within the try block
- Changed parseTrans from protected to public so that test cases can access it.

- Changed the call of parseTrans in the Backend.java to use "concat.txt"
- Changed Transaction from nothing to public so that test cases can access it
    - Changed all variables in Transactions from nothing to public so that test cases can access it
- Changed FileUpdater to public so that test cases can access it.
- Changed fileWriter from protected to public so that test cases can access it
