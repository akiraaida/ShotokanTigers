COMPLETED
=====
1. Load the master bank accounts file in and store the data into a data structure.
    - Data structure name = map
    - Data is stored in a Map<String, ArrayList<Account>>
    - Name of the user is the key, they will have 1 or more accounts
    - Each account has an account number, account status, balance, number of transactions, and if they are a student or non-student.

2. Merge transactions files
    - If 1 or more transaction files then all information is put into the file "concat.txt"

3. Load the transactions file in and store the data into a data structure
    - data structure name = transactions
    - Transactions are stored in an ArrayList<Transaction>
    - Transaction Code_Name_Account Number_Amount of Money_Misc

4. Use the map data structure and the transactions data structure to create a new master bank accounts file.
- NNNNN_AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA_S_PPPPPPPP_TTTT_Q
- Account Number_Name_Active/Disabled_Bank Balance_Number of Transactions_Student/Non-Student

5. Debit the accounts 0.05 for each student plan transaction or 0.10 for each non-student plan transaction

6. Need to do proper error checking when reading the transactions (eg. login before deposit)

7. Finished google reformattings:
  - Fixed naming of functions, fields & variables, where appropriate
  - Check todos in code (could be clarified/outdated)
  - Add boilerplate to each file
  - remove wildcard imports
  - check variable declarations (4.8.2)
  - Things to change in UML and in code:
    - Transaction Calculator
      - accountTable should not be public, should be private
  - check for missing braces on one-liner if, else, etc. (4.1.1)
  - whitespaceish things
    - check whitespace for ifs and such (4.6.2)
    - indentation, probably
    - check bracket newlines
    - check line wrapping
    - check switch statement according to 4.8.4
  - documentation
    - check block comments have *
    - check javadoc
      - fixed <p> wrapping and added tags where absent (7.1.2)
      - added fragments where absent
      - aligned stars with last star of /**
    - distinguished between comments and javadoc

8. Finished UML reformattings:
  - FileParser
    - Move 'MasterAccounts.txt' to Backend(?)
    - ACTIVE: Change from public symbol to private symbol
      STUDENT: Change from public symbol to private symbol
      END: Change from public symbol to private symbol
      ParseMaster: Change from public symbol to protected symbol
      concatTrans: Change from public symbol to protected symbol
      parseTrans: Change from public symbol to protected symbol
    - concat.txt.out --> concat.txt : out
  - FileUpdater
    - missing connection:
      - Account
    - typo on parameters fileWriter method
      (accounts(Map...):void) --> (accounts : Map...): void
    - move concat.txt to FileParser
    - typo on newMasterAccount.txt --> newMaster.txt
      - could change to fit, or to something like "New Master Account File"?
    - fileWriter: Change from public symbol to protected symbol
    - createAccount: Change from public symbol to private symbol
  - TransactionCalculator
    - missing connection:
      - Transaction
      - TransactionType
    - typo on handleDisabke --> handleDisable
    - change private variables account_table_, is_logged_in, is_admin_ to
      accountTable, isLoggedIn, isAdmin
    - accountTable should not be public, should be private
  - Backend
      - missing connections:
        - Transaction
      - typo on name "BackEnd" --> Backend to match file
      - Add TransactionFiles: in
        - FileParser: Remove TransactionFiles:in (Since the input is taken in the main and passed to FileParser)
        - Should remove .txt from "MasterAccountsFile.txt";
            as name is a parameter for the program
  - Transaction
    - missing connection:
      - "code" is implicitly of type TransactionType
        --> should probably leave as int type, but add relationship
    - change name --> accountName
    - change num --> accountNumber
  - Account
    - missing connections:
      - Account
    - change stat --> isActive
    - change bal --> balance
    - change trans --> transactionCount
    - change plan --> isStudentPlan
  - TransactionType
    - typo on WIDTHDRAWAL --> WITHDRAWAL
    
9. Comment functions and classes
  - Double check that all functions/classes have documentation now
