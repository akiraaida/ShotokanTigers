Notes:
----
- May have to do transaction fee withdrawal before transaction??? e_e
	- To represent fee, could put marker in MM space for readability?
- For transfers, should system magically know the name of recipient?
- For transfers, should transferred money be available right away?
- Possibility of a 'don't care' character?
- Enter 'your' account number?
	- & 'Please' consistency
	- & New balance consistency
	--> migrate to 'available balance'
- may have to take consideration of holes somehow(missing enable 4 & 5)
- Should sessions end with a prompt?
	- End with "Please enter session type"?
- transaction width should be 40 but is 41
- fix confusion between person x being whatever and person's account
- do all functions have a positive input combinations/ should works?
- should nonexistent name then ask for an account number?
- make list of responses?
	- typo on specified
	- do spellcheck in general
- Display prompt after error? (i.e. fail gracefully)?
