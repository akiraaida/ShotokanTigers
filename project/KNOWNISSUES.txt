ISSUES
=================

General
1. Issue with "ERROR, INVALID COMMAND" when piping some commands in. Appears to be something to do with the input buffers.
    - Does not happen for every test case
    - Causes alot of correct test cases to fail
    - NEEDS TO BE FIXED URGENTLY

Deposit
1. Takes negative values and 0. Need to change it to greater than 0.
2. Takes non numeral characters. After investigation on slack, I don't believe it matters the exact format as long as the invalid characters are removed.
    - eg. $5.00, 5,00, 5$, abc, etc. should all error with the command "ERROR, INVALID INPUT." whereas 5, 5.00, .5, etc. is manageable.
3. Unconfirmed issue: Not sure what happens if a non-student account deposits 0.05 when the withdrawal fee is 0.10 (if the account was initially at 0).    
4. Failing test cases due to General's #1

Create
1. Program terminates early if the input for the name is greater than 20 characters
  - Should truncate instead of erroring according to slack
2. Terminating early when max initial balance error occurs
3. Failing test cases due to General's #1

Delete
1. Failing test cases due to General's #1
2. Uncomfirmed issue: Not sure if users can log into a deleted account or not. In the current implementation they can.
