When an issue is fixed or confirmed not happening, remove it.

General
1. Issue with "ERROR, INVALID COMMAND" when piping some commands in. Appears to be something to do with the input buffers.
    - Does not happen for every test case
    - Causes alot of correct test cases to fail
    - NEEDS TO BE FIXED URGENTLY

1. Takes negative values and 0. Need to change it to greater than 0.
2. Takes non numeral characters. After investigation, I don't believe it matters the exact format as long as the invalid characters are removed.
    - eg. $5.00, 5,00, 5$, abc, etc. should all error with the command "ERROR, INVALID INPUT." whereas 5, 5.00, .5, etc. is manageable.
3. Unconfirmed issue: Not sure what happens if a non-student account deposits 0.05 when the withdrawal fee is 0.10 (if the account was initially at 0).    
4. Failing test cases due to General's #1
