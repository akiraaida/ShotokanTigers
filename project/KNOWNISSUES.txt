ISSUES
=================

Deposit
1. Takes non numeral characters. After investigation on slack, I don't believe it matters the exact format as long as the invalid characters are removed.
    - eg. $5.00, 5,00, 5$, abc, etc. should all error with the command "ERROR, INVALID INPUT." whereas 5, 5.00, .5, etc. is manageable.
    - not sure how to parse for solely a number
2. Failing test cases due to General's #1

Delete
1. Uncomfirmed clarification: Not sure if users can log into a deleted account or not. In the current implementation they can.
