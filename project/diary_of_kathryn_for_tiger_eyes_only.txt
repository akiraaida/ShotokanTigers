1. In response to failures related to buffer overflows, I decided to make
  functions GetString, GetInteger, and GetDouble. Since the commands class is
  pretty crowded and the functionality is relevant to main, I elected to place
  it in a new class/namespace as "ConsoleInput", implemented as static
  functions. The use of this function accomplishes the following:
    a. Resolves the bug revealed by our tests
    b. Prevents this bug from occuring in locations not revealed in our tests
    c. Reduces clutter in the code due to the 2+ lines needed for this behaviour
    d. If our new std::getline approach causes issues in future, all instances
        of the pattern can be fixed at once.
2. Failures found after I made those changes (before the last 3 funcs):
  - depo003
    This test case tests for invalid symbols, and failed where it had passed
    before as a result of the change in console input extraction; instead of
    notifying the user that it's input was nonnumeric, it would instead claim
    that the value was too small. The implementation of the "GetDouble" call in
    the deposit function was faulty in two ways: Firstly, it was placed outside
    of the try/catch loop, and thus could not trigger the invalid number
    response; Secondly, the implementation of "GetDouble" switched from the use
    of stod, which throws an exception, to atof, which does not. To squash this
    bug I changed the implementation of GetDouble and GetInteger to use the
    exception throwing functions, and to return an error value when the number
    parse failed. Then, in deposit, I removed the try/catch loop and had the
    program check for these error values. As a result, the test no longer
    failed.
3. Certain test cases failed as the program was not yet printing out account
balances.
  - depo002
  - depo004
  - depo005
  - depo006
  - depo007
  - enab004
  - payb006
  - payb007
  - payb008
  - payb009
  - payb010
  - payb012
  - payb013
  - payb014
  - with005
  - with006
  - with007
  - with008
  - with009
  - with010
  - with011
  - with012
  - with013
  - with014
  - with016
Since each of these cases made a call to a function that affected the balance, a
printout of the balance was expected.
4. To resolve this issue, a function was created. This created function calls in
  the correct places. While the function call was implemented, none of the above
  test cases was corrected by this fix alone.
  

5. While fixing test cases, I uncovered another error similar to the newline 
  issue covered before: my text editor was stripping trailing whitespace from my
  .out files. This became an issue for prompts such as 'Please enter the account
  number: ' which have a space in output as part of the formatting in the
  program. Since there was no specification in our test cases for how the input
  should look as it was being typed, and my intention at the time was warped by
  this automatic behaviour, I elected to have the single trailing whitespace be
  the correct behaviour. Accordingly, for each of the test cases I worked on
  (deposit, enable, paybill, withdrawal) this was an issue.
  
  The solution was to correct the amount of whitespace in the .out files.
  
6. Double Prompt 
  Problem:
    The problem was that some of our test
    cases were failing because there was a double prompt at the end.
   Affected:
    This must have been an issue for all test cases. 
   Solution:s
    The solve for this was to have the
    loop terminate when end of file was found.
    
7. Account Balance Forgotten
  Problem:
    Certain test cases did not check account balance, and needed to account for
    it.
  Solution:
    The following test files needed to be changed:
    - depo002.in
    - 
    
8. Deposit Prompt
- commands.cc:
  - For the deposits in the program, I changed the prompt style to
   "Please enter amount to deposit: ", as used in the test cases. This affected
   the following .out files:
   - all deposit cases
   - 
  
Various things:
----
- depo004
  depo004.out:
  - initial prompt was not 'Please enter a command:'
  - changed 'enter the user's number' to 'enter the user's account number" for 
    consistency
