1. In response to failures related to buffer overflows, I decided to make
  functions GetString, GetInteger, and GetDouble. Since the commands class is
  pretty crowded and the functionality is relevant to main, I elected to place
  it in a new class/namespace as "ConsoleInput", implemented as static
  functions. The use of this function accomplishes the following:
    a. Resolves the bug revealed by our tests
    b. Prevents this bug from occuring in locations not revealed in our tests
    c. Reduces clutter in the code due to the 2+ lines needed for this behaviour
    d. If our new std::getline approach causes issues in future, all instances
        of the pattern can be fixed at once.
2. Failures found after I made those changes (before the last 3 funcs):
  - depo003
    This test case tests for invalid symbols, and failed where it had passed
    before as a result of the change in console input extraction; instead of
    notifying the user that it's input was nonnumeric, it would instead claim
    that the value was too small. The implementation of the "GetDouble" call in
    the deposit function was faulty in two ways: Firstly, it was placed outside
    of the try/catch loop, and thus could not trigger the invalid number
    response; Secondly, the implementation of "GetDouble" switched from the use
    of stod, which throws an exception, to atof, which does not. To squash this
    bug I changed the implementation of GetDouble and GetInteger to use the
    exception throwing functions, and to return an error value when the number
    parse failed. Then, in deposit, I removed the try/catch loop and had the
    program check for these error values. As a result, the test no longer
    failed.
3. Certain test cases failed as the program was not yet printing out account
balances.
  - depo002
  - depo004
  - depo005
  - depo006
  - depo007
  - enab004
  - payb006
  - payb007
  - payb008
  - payb009
  - payb010
  - payb012
  - payb013
  - payb014
  - with005
  - with006
  - with007
  - with008
  - with009
  - with010
  - with011
  - with012
  - with013
  - with014
  - with016
Since each of these cases made a call to a function that affected the balance, a
printout of the balance was expected.
4. To resolve this issue, a function was created. This created function calls in
  the correct places. While the function call was implemented, none of the above
  test cases was corrected by this fix alone.
